This is a project aimed at testing Rust WebAssembly (WASM) for creating a GitHub portfolio.

The goal is to showcase my Rust programming skills and demonstrate the ability to build web applications using Yew, a modern Rust framework for creating web frontends.

## Yew

Yew is a modern Rust framework for building web applications. It allows developers to write client-side web applications using Rust's strong type system and memory safety guarantees. Yew follows a component-based architecture similar to popular JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js.

With Yew, you can create reusable and composable components that encapsulate both the UI and the logic of your web application. Yew leverages Rust's ownership model to ensure efficient memory management and eliminate common bugs like null pointer exceptions and memory leaks.

Yew also provides a virtual DOM implementation, which allows for efficient updates to the user interface by only modifying the parts of the DOM that have changed. This helps to optimize performance and improve the user experience.

Overall, Yew enables developers to leverage the power of Rust to build fast, reliable, and secure web applications. It combines the benefits of Rust's safety and performance with the productivity and flexibility of a modern web framework.

## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency...

## WASM

WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format that is designed to be executed in a web browser. It is a low-level virtual machine that allows developers to run code written in languages such as C, C++, and Rust on the web.

WASM provides a portable and efficient way to execute code in a web environment, enabling high-performance web applications. It is designed to be fast, secure, and compatible with existing web technologies.

With WASM, developers can write code in languages other than JavaScript and compile it to a binary format that can be executed by the browser. This opens up new possibilities for web development, allowing developers to leverage the performance and capabilities of languages like Rust while still being able to integrate with existing web technologies.

Overall, WASM is a powerful technology that extends the capabilities of web browsers and enables developers to build complex and performant web applications using a wide range of programming languages.
